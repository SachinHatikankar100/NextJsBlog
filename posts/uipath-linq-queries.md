- In this blog, I have documented a series of frequently asked linq queries related interview questions.

- **_What is Linq query_**

  - Language-Integrated Query (LINQ) is the name for a set of technologies based on the integration of query capabilities directly into the C# language. Traditionally, queries against data are expressed as simple strings without type checking at compile time or IntelliSense support. Furthermore, you have to learn a different query language for each type of data source: SQL databases, XML documents, various Web services, and so on. With LINQ, a query is a first-class language construct, just like classes, methods, events. You write queries against strongly typed collections of objects by using language keywords and familiar operators. The LINQ family of technologies provides a consistent query experience for objects (LINQ to Objects), relational databases (LINQ to SQL), and XML (LINQ to XML).

- **_Benefits of Linq Queries_**

  - Familiar language: Developers don't have to learn a new query language for each type of data source or data format.
  - Less coding: It reduces the amount of code to be written as compared with a more traditional approach.
  - Readable code: LINQ makes the code more readable so other developers can easily understand and maintain it.
  - Standardized way of querying multiple data sources: The same LINQ syntax can be used to query multiple data sources.
  - Compile time safety of queries: It provides type checking of objects at compile time.
  - IntelliSense Support: LINQ provides IntelliSense for generic collections.
  - Shaping data: You can retrieve data in different shapes.
